What is Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is defined as a sequence of activities conducted to perform Software Testing. It consists of a series
of activities carried out methodologically to help certify your software product.
  1. Requirement Analysis ->
  2. Test Planning -> 
  3. Test case development ->
  4. Test Environment setup -> 
  5. Test Execution ->
  6. Test Cycle closure

Different Phases of the STLC Model
 STLC Diagram
Below are the phases of STLC:
1.	Requirement Analysis
2.	Test Planning
3.	Test case development
4.	Test Environment setup
5.	Test Execution
6.	Test Cycle closure

1. Requirement Analysis
During this phase test team studies the requirements from a testing point of view to identify the testable requirements. The QA team may
interact with various stakeholders (Client, Business Analyst, Technical Leads and System Architects etc) to understand the requirements
in detail.Requirements could be either Functional (defining what the software must do) or Non Functional (defining system performance 
/security availability)

Activities
  •	Identify types of tests to be performed. 
  •	Gather details about testing priorities and focus.
  •	Prepare Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).
  •	Identify test environment details where testing is supposed to be carried out. 
  •	Automation feasibility analysis (if required).
Deliverables
  • RTM
  •	Automation feasibility report. (if applicable)

2. Test Planning
In this stage, a Senior QA, manager will determine effort and cost estimates for the project and would prepare and finalize the Test 
Plan. In this phase, Test Strategy is also determined.

Activities
  •	Preparation of test plan/strategy document for various types of testing
  •	Test tool selection 
  •	Test effort estimation 
  •	Resource planning and determining roles and responsibilities.
  •	Training requirement

Deliverables 
  •	Test plan /strategy document.
  •	Effort estimation document.

3. Test Case Development
This phase involves the creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts. Test data, is identified/created and is reviewed
and then reworked as well.

Activities
  •	Create test cases, automation scripts (if applicable)
  •	Review and baseline test cases and scripts 
  •	Create test data (If Test Environment is available)

Deliverables 
  •	Test cases/scripts 
  • Test data

4. Test Environment Setup
Test environment decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is going to be tested. Test environment set-up 
is one of the critical aspects of testing process and can be done in parallel with Test Case Development Stage. Test team may not be 
involved in this activity if the customer/development team provides the test environment in which case the test team is required to do 
a readiness check (smoke testing) of the given environment.

Activities 
  •	Understand the required architecture, environment set-up and prepare hardware and software requirement list for the Test Environment.
  •	Setup test Environment and test data 
  •	Perform smoke test on the build

Deliverables 
  •	Environment ready with test data set up 
  •	Smoke Test Results.

5. Test Execution
During this phase, the testers will carry out the testing as per the test plans and the prepared test cases. Bugs will be reported back 
to the development team for correction and retesting will be performed.

Activities
  •	Execute test cases as per test plan doc.
  •	Document test results, and log defects for failed cases 
  •	Map defects to test cases in RTM 
  •	Retest the Defect fixes 
  •	Track the defects to closure
  
Deliverables 
  •	Completed RTM with the execution status
  •	Test cases updated with results
  •	Defect reports

6. Test Cycle Closure
Testing team will meet, discuss and analyze testing artifacts to identify strategies that have to be implemented in the future taking 
lessons from the current test cycle. The idea is to remove the process bottlenecks for future test cycles and share best practices for 
any similar projects in the future.

Activities
  •	Evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Time, Test coverage, Cost, Software, Critical Business Objectives, Quality
  •	Prepare test metrics based on the above parameters. 
  •	Document the learning out of the project 
  •	Prepare Test closure report 
  •	Qualitative and quantitative reporting of quality of the work product to the customer. 
  •	Test result analysis to find out the defect distribution by type and severity.

Deliverables 
  •	Test Closure report 
  •	Test metrics

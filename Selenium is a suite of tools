Selenium is a suite of tools. It consists of Selenium IDE, Selenium RC, Selenium Web driver, and Selenium Grid

1.	Selenium IDE:
Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a Firefox plug-in. It is the simplest framework in the Selenium Suite. 
It allows us to record and playback the scripts. Even though we can create scripts using Selenium IDE, we need to use Selenium RC or 
Selenium WebDriver to write more advanced and robust test cases.

2.	Selenium RC:
Selenium RC/Selenium 1. Selenium RC was the main Selenium project for a long time before the WebDriver merge brought up Selenium 2. 
Selenium 1 is still actively supported (in maintenance mode). It relies on JavaScript for automation. It supports Java, JavaScript, Ruby, 
PHP, Python, Perl and C# . It supports almost every browser out there.
Note: Selenium RC is officially deprecated.

3.	Selenium WebDriver:
Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that accepts commands and sends them to a browser. It is implemented through a 
browser-specific driver. It controls the browser by directly communicating with it. Selenium WebDriver supports Java, C#, PHP, Python, 
Perl, Ruby.
Operation System Support – Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Solaris
Browser Support – Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome 12.0.712.0 and above, Safari, Opera 11.5 and above, Android, iOS, HtmlUnit 2.9 and above

4.	Selenium Grid:
Selenium Grid is a tool used together with Selenium RC to run tests on different machines against different browsers in parallel. That is, 
running multiple tests at the same time against different machines running different browsers and operating systems.

Selenium Web Driver is a well designed object oriented API supports many languages such as Java, C#, Python etc. 
Let’s see what is API and then we move on to know the complete picture of Selenium WebDriver Architecture.
